# Abstract

On the BitShares Blockchain the `account_update_operation` allows to change account
related settings. In the current implementation all possible settings have to be
passed to the operation, to not override old settings. This is inconvenient
because in certain situations there is no need in changing all settings.

In this BSIP the `account_update_votes_operation` is introduced, which solves the
described problem.

# Motivation

The current `account_update_operation` forces the user to pass all possible account
settings, to not override existing ones. This is inconvinient and also requires a
higher payload to be stored on the blockchain, thus results in a higher fee.

To reduce the fee the `account_update_votes_operation` is introduced to update only
a part of the `account data`.

This new operation will be particularily useful in conjunction with
[BSIP40](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0040.md)
which will allow to assign a specific key for this operation and
simplifies life for voters, significantly.

# Rational

The `account_update_votes_operation` is an account related operation and allows to set
variables in the `account_object`. The targeted variables of this operation are located
in the `account_options field` of the `account_object`.

- `voting_account`  (the voting account to use)
- `num_witness`     (number of witness votes)
- `num_committee`   (number of committee votes)
- `votes`           (list of `vote_id_type`)

As described before to not override existing settings, every other needed variable is fetched
with the database, when the operation is evaluated.

# Specifications

This BSIP comes with a change to the protocol, which requires a propotocol upgrade.

In the following an exemplary implementation is given.

    struct account_update_votes_operation : public base_operation
    {
     asset fee;
     /// The account to update
     account_id_type account;
     /// New account options
     flat_set<vote_id_type>    votes_to_add;
     flat_set<vote_id_type>    votes_to_remove;
     // a new voting account to set
     optional<account_id_type> voting_account;
     // a new number of witness_votes to set
     optional<uint16_t> num_witness;
     // a new number of commitee_votes to set
     optional<uint16_t> num_committee;
     // for future extensions (see account_update_operation)
     extensions_type extensions;
    };


We propose to allow adding and removing votes individually by means of
defining a *list* of vote ids to be added or removed. This has multiple
advantages:

* Reduces the size of the operation compared to replacing the entire
  slate
* Allows to easily compare votes before and after the operation

Setting the proxy is explicitly not part of this opertation.
Authors of this BSIP came to the conclusion that proxy settings should
require `active authority`. It is their opinion that setting proxy
settings are distinct from voting.

# Summary for Shareholders

This BSIP simplifies the way voting occurs on the blockchain and will
later (together with BSIP40) simplify automated voting without
compromising the account.
