# Abstract

This BSIP proposes a protocol change so that the committee can define
different fee rates for maker orders and taker orders.

# Motivation

To improve liquidity of the BitShares DEX.

# Rationale

The maker-taker fee model is adopted widely in centralized exchanges and
helped them to attract trading activities.

In the BitShares DEX, for each filled order, the owner of the order need to
pay an order creation fee and conditionally a market fee. [BSIP 81](
https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0081.md) described
a way to apply the maker-taker fee model to the market fee. This BSIP
describes a way to apply the maker-taker fee model to the order creation fee.

# Specification

Add a new global parameter `maker_fee_discount_percent` which can
be updated by the committee only after the protocol upgrade.
Initial value of that parameter is `0`.
Valid range of that parameter is `[0, 100%]`.

When a limit order with a non-zero pending fee is filled or partially filled,
* if the order is a take order, process the pending fee as before;
* if the order is a maker order, return
`pending_fee * maker_fee_discount_percent` (round down) to the owner,
then process the remaining pending fee as before.
 Note: similar to [BSIP 26](
https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0026.md), in case when
 the order creation fee was paid in an asset which was not BTS,
 return an amount of BTS to the asset's fee pool and
 return an amount of that asset to the order owner.
