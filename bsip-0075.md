# Abstract
This BSIP moves adjustments to MCR and MSSR values to the asset owner.

# Motivation
Asset owners are often in the best position to control the values of MCR and MSSR of their asset. Therefore, they should be able to have direct control to adjust those values.

# Rationale
Prior to this change, adjustments to MCR and MSSR were handled by feed producers. This often requires the asset owner to contact the feed producer and ask for the change. For some assets, such a step is time consuming for both parties and ill-fitted as part of the feed producer's responsibilities.

This new change will permit the asset owner to determine at asset creation time which should have the responsibility to maintain those values.

# Specification
The `asset_object` will contain a parameter that determines if the value is stored as part of the asset_object, or if it is pulled from the feed.

The `create_asset_operation` will include the setting of the parameter above, as well as initial values for MCR and MSSR.

The `update_asset_operation` will permit updating of the MCR and MSSR values, if the asset has been created with the permission for the asset owner to do so.

If price feeds arrive with MCR and MSSR values for an asset who's asset owner is in control of those values, the feed values will be ignored.

# Discussion

# Summary for Shareholders
For some assets, having feed producers control MCR and MSSR values is cumbersome and ill-fitting. This BSIP allows asset owners to decide at asset creation time if the responsibility of those values should be from feed producers consensus or set directly by the asset owner themselves.
