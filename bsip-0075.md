# Abstract
This BSIP provides the ability for the asset creator to decide if adjustments to the Maintenance Collateral Ratio (MCR) and and the Maximum Short Squeeze Ratio (MSSR) should be done by the asset owner or by price feed providers.

# Motivation
Asset owners are often in the best position to control the values of MCR and MSSR of their asset. Therefore, they should be able to have direct control to adjust those values, should they choose to allow themselves.

# Rationale
Prior to this change, adjustments to MCR and MSSR were handled by feed producers. This often requires the asset owner to contact the feed producer and ask for the change. For some assets, such a step is time consuming for both parties and ill-fitted as part of the feed producer's responsibilities.

This new change shall permit the asset owner to determine at asset creation time which should have the responsibility to maintain those values.

# Specification
The `asset_object.asset_options.flags` shall contain the new flag `issuer_fed_asset` that determines if MCR and MSSR values are stored as part of the asset_object, or if it is pulled from the feeds.

The `create_asset_operation` shall be modified to include the setting of the parameter above, as well as initial values for MCR and MSSR.

The `update_asset_operation` shall be modified permit updating of the MCR and MSSR values, if the asset has been created with the permission for the asset owner to do so. NOTE: much of the logic currently in `asset_publish_feeds_evaluator::do_apply()` (i.e. call order checks and calculations) shall be also called here if MCR and MSSR are adjusted.

If price feeds arrive with MCR and MSSR values for an asset who's owner is in control of those values, the feed values shall be ignored if the feed does not come from the asset owner.

# Discussion

# Summary for Shareholders
For some assets, having feed producers control MCR and MSSR values is cumbersome and ill-fitting. This BSIP allows asset owners to decide at asset creation time if the responsibility of those values should be from feed producers' consensus or set directly by the asset owner themselves.
