# Abstract
Closing a short position comes with a risk of getting margin called if no spare funds are available to buy the long and reduce the debt to zero. This BSIP introduces a way to put the short position directly on the market.

# Rationale
Closing a short position with a healthy CR should come with no risk of getting margin called.

# Specification
Introduce a way that user can directly place orders to sell collateral in a margin position, and the received SmartCoins will be used to reduce the debt automatically.

User needs to define the amount to sell and amount to receive while placing the sell orders, and the 
price should be greater or equal to debt/collateral, to ensure the deposit position CR will not be reduced after the filling of the sell orders.

When a debt position is margin called with close short orders,system delete all the close short orders and place margin call orders. 

When user adjust the debt position, system will check whether the target debt position conflicts with the close short orders, if yes than reject to adjust.

# Discussion
Another process logic is also possible when a debt position is margin called or margin call orders change with close short orders,system check whether the margin call conflict with the close short orders via a defined logic, if yes than delete all the close short orders and place margin call orders, if not just place margin call orders without deleting the close short orders.

This logic bring better user experience but also complexity. it is also a good choice if the complexity is acceptable from developer's perspective.
